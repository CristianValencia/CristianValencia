# About the guy

Hello there! I am Cristian Valencia, a Software Engineer located in Mexico.

I am currently developing and delivering awesome mobile applications using Xamarin.Forms, Flutter and Swift UI. 

Performing as a mobile app developer as well as an enthusiast Software Architect, I really like to create healthy and scalable projects for the clients I work with. 

As of now, I am working some secret stuff with cryptocurrencies, so if you're interested in being part of it, you're welcome to reach me out!

Chill out and read some random facts:

 âš¡ I cannot live without an external monitor. I own a 38-inch screen and it is absolutely gorgeous.

âš¡ My brain gets inspired at night. Like really late!

âš¡ People always say I look younger than what my real age is. Maybe sleeping late at night is the key!





## Roadmap

- I want to become a fully featured mobile architect. Working on it and learning lotsa stuff!
- I want to be a refferal in the MAUI world when it launches. Preparing myself for it!
- Create my YouTube channel, where I can share some of the things I learn day by day.
